How to design a generic algorithm, referring to *essential c++* 3.6.  
The purpose is to make filter() as flexible as possible.  
Steps below show the ditails to achieve this purpose.
1. Find all numbers less than 10 from a vector. 
2. Use function call instead of comparing values directly by passing arround a function pointer.
3. Import 'function object', which is more efficient than function pointer.
4. Use function template and iterator to support more element type and more container type.
