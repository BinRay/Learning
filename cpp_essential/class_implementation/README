This project shows the essential elements of a class:
1. express how to implement a class and what 'private' or 'public' mean.
2. what are class constructors and the class destructor.
3. in const member function, we can change 'mutable' member data.
4. how to use 'static'
5. build a iterator with 'friend' and operator override. 
6. we can also override to implement a copy assignment operator and a function object'()' and iostream'<<', etc.
